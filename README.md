<h1> AutonomousATC --- An AI-automated Air-traffic Safety Model </h1>

In this project, we train a reinforcement learning model to predict and resolve air conflicts in approach/departure phase of air traffic control (ATC). 

# Implemented:
* A transformer-based aircraft conflict and restricted area invasion detection model.
* Data pipeline to handle ADS-B aircraft data from BlueSky simulator.
* A BlueSky simulator plugin to handle approach/departure scenarios and commands.
* Reinforcement learning infrastructures.

# Not Implemented Yet:
* A Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) conflict resolving model.
* A standalone GUI for monitor.
